OAI to RDF mapping
==================

Last updated: Mar 10, 2005

Requirements:
==========================

	* SWI-Prolog 5.5.10
	* Triple20 (CVS version, see
	  http://www.swi-prolog.org/packages/Triple20

Installation
============

[still very much `development']

	* On Unix, edit #!... line in run.pl to point to Prolog
	* In load.pl, edit file_search_path to reflect location of
	  Triple20 sources.
	* In oai.pl, add identifiers and URLs of servers you wan to
	  access.

Running (example uses fontys):

	* Start run.pl
	* To get server identifier, run

		?- sp(fontys).

	* To get records

		?- gr(fontys).

	* To start Triple20 in environment, so you can examine the
	loaded data:

		?- triple20.

	* To generate an RDF file:

		?- rdf_save('fontys.rdf', fontys).

Roadmap
=======

	run.pl		Toplevel driver
	load.pl		load the components
	oai.pl		AOI HTTP client, calling user hook to process
			OAI content.
	oairdf.pl	Uses oai.pl, providing a hook to translate into RDF
	t20_extensions.pl	Define some extensions to Triple20
	oai.rdfs	RDFS description of AOI records (partial) used to
			guide translation.
